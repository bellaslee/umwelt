        <h2>01. brainstorming</h2>
        <p>We kicked off our hackathon session by first identifying the track, and then the related problem spaces that we were interested in. We decided to approach vitality from four perspectives: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. We realized, however, that many of these areas overlap, and that vitality extends to all areas of life. Our favorite ideas were burnout society, time in nature, and sustainable knowledge, so we discussed these areas more in-depth, then proceeded to research and design.</p>

        <h2>2. problem space</h2>
        <p>Burnout is a prevalent issue in today‚Äôs fast-paced society, as highlighted by Byung-Chul Han in his book The Burnout Society. Burnout is not a medical diagnosis. Rather, it is characterized by intense emotional exhaustion. This is caused by the productivity-focused, auto-exploitative society, as well as the information overload that comes with social media. Space today seems to be less ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù and more ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù. To combat this, we hope to provide uninterrupted time through Umwelt to help people recenter and revitalize. We provide small milestones for people to accomplish in a gamified manner. We chose walking through nature as an activity due to its accessibility and effectiveness, though, if we had more time, we would like to consider the design question of ‚Äúhow can we accommodate those who are not able-bodied or do not have safe communities to walk in?‚Äù Though we recognize that this is a systematic issue, we hope to make incremental changes through micro-interventions like Umwelt.</p>

        <p>Our team collaborated on the low-fidelity design process, then began to branch off into high-fidelity design (Annie and Stephanie), research and web development (Bella), and iOS development (Sean).</p>
