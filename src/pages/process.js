        <h2>01. brainstorming</h2>
        <p>We kicked off our hackathon session by first identifying the track, and then the related problem spaces that we were interested in. We decided to approach vitality from four perspectives: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. We realized, however, that many of these areas overlap, and that vitality extends to all areas of life. Our favorite ideas were burnout society, time in nature, and sustainable knowledge, so we discussed these areas more in-depth, then proceeded to research and design. <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/nrRVzLhFi5ExRH9g1RrOas/DubHacks-23'?type=whiteboard&node-id=24%3A823&t=DbIqjDzRqKzTpIH9-1" target="_blank">You can view our chaotic brainstorming FigJam file here.</a></p>

        <h2>2. problem space</h2>
        <p>Burnout is a prevalent issue in today‚Äôs fast-paced society, as highlighted by Byung-Chul Han in his book The Burnout Society. Burnout is not a medical diagnosis. Rather, it is characterized by intense emotional exhaustion. This is caused by the productivity-focused, auto-exploitative society, as well as the information overload that comes with social media. Space today seems to be less ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù and more ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù. To combat this, we hope to provide uninterrupted time through Umwelt to help people recenter and revitalize. We provide small milestones for people to accomplish in a gamified manner. We chose walking through nature as an activity due to its accessibility and effectiveness, though, if we had more time, we would like to consider the design question of ‚Äúhow can we accommodate those who are not able-bodied or do not have safe communities to walk in?‚Äù Though we recognize that this is a systematic issue, we hope to make incremental changes through micro-interventions like Umwelt.</p>

        <h2>3. process</h2>
        <p>Our team collaborated on the low-fidelity design process, then began to branch off into high-fidelity design (Annie and Stephanie), research and web development (Bella), and iOS development (Sean). Annie and Stephanie worked with Figma and Adobe Illustrator; Bella worked with Next.js, GSAP, SASS, and Bootstrap; and Sean worked with Swift. We maintained open communication and discussion throughout the process to ensure we stayed on the right track and adhered to our initial visions.</p>
        <h3>3.1 design</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/9X5AabfVYMBYkwerbrBOYy/DubHacks-23'?type=design&node-id=32%3A1400&mode=design&t=Ziw28LGMl86lQXhO-1" target="_blank">View our Figma wireframes here</a></p>
        <p>We were inspired by Taiwan Design Expo and other minimalistic, whimsical designs for our branding.</p>
        <img src="/img/inspiration.jpeg" alt="" className="report" />
        <h3>3.2 iOS development</h3>
        <p>We worked on design and development simultaneously to cover more ground as a team.</p>

        <h2>04. challenges</h2>
        <p>As a team, our main challenge was brainstorming ways to use technology to encourage independence from it. For Sean, it was challenging to learn how to use iOS frameworks for the camera and map under time constraints. For Annie and Stephanie, the linear user flow was challenging due to being different from what you‚Äôd expect from a typical app.</p>

        <h2>05. what we're proud of</h2>
        <p>This is our first in-person hackathon experience, so we are proud of coming this far under immense time pressure. Our ideation process was highly enjoyable, and we are proud of stepping out of our comfort zones to design an experience rather than a tool. We also figured out our strengths quickly and adapted to fit them into the creation process.</p>

        <h2>06. takeaways</h2>
        <p>So much‚Ä¶ The design team learned how to animate boxes, Sean learned iOS animation and frameworks, Bella learned new front-end animation and interaction techniques, and we all learned how to collaborate within a cross-functional team.</p>

She worked on the ideation process as well as using figma to create low and high fidelity prototypes, and additionally using Figma to create the animations for our visual assets.</p>
        <p><a href="https://bellalee.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Lee</a> is an Informatics student at the University of Washington. She worked on the ideation process, literature review, product management, front-end web development, and copywriting, with a focus on marketing and stakeholder connection.</p>
        <p><a href="https://minorenji.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Lim</a> is a Computer Science student at the University of Washington. He worked on the mobile app prototype. Although he has tried developing for iOS before, it was his first time using frameworks like AVFoundation (Camera) and MapKit. Overall, he enjoyed being able to rapidly implement an idea.</p>
